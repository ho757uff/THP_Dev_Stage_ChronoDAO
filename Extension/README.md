# THP_Dev_Stage_ChronoDAO

This Repository is dedicated to develop tools for users of the OpenLoot website and market-place.
At the moment we're aiming to develop :
 - a standalone Extension which will serve as an asset/value tracker for users on openloot.com
 - a set of tools to implement in the website of the ChronoDAO, in order to further answer the need of reliable online aids when it comes to Web3 Gaming
